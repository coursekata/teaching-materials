Teachers can modify the survey to add/remove questions better suited for their class. This is a dataset that can be useful for referencing throughout the course in order to demonstrate various concepts because it provides a personalized set of data with a data point that actually represents each student individually. There is also an optional activity to participate in a memory experiment.\n\n#### Includes:\n\n- Practice thinking about where data come from\n- Distinguishing measurement error from mistakes\n- Practice operationalizing ideas such as the *best* way to measure your finger\n- Taking part in an experiment (memory experiment)\n- Thinking about how variation in one variable (e.g., level of processing) can affect another variable (e.g., memory recall)","block_group":"88d29670403f4387b78eb17c3ddba3b0"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"trusted":true,"source_hash":"9d70ea66","execution_start":1625712662352,"execution_millis":3618,"deepnote_cell_height":129.953125,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"cell_id":"2234ab8e3bbf4c3c818fae0cbaf15dab","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# This code will load the R packages we will use\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n    library(coursekata)\n})","block_group":"715ca0bbc15245488919705f63164d09","execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"outputs_reference":null,"content_dependencies":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_height":419.0625,"cell_id":"d00bb5351d414c129b9969a6bd119e63","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## 1.0 - How do we get data?\nWe use data to try and understand variation in all kinds of things: climate change, poverty, politics, psychology, health, etc. But that means we need to measure all kinds of things that are hard to measure. How do we measure how smart, happy, or healthy someone is? How powerful, free, or secure a country is? Once we get that data, we want to use data science to figure out whether this stuff changes, improves, differs across people, or predicts some future outcome, and much more.\n\nBut it all starts with figuring out measurement -- how would we know how much of something exists? How would we know how that thing varies across people, animals, families, companies, countries?\n \nLet’s start by measuring something easy: Yourself!  \n\nWe'll take some measurements and collect some data using a portion of the [Student Census](https://ww2.amstat.org/CensusAtSchool/index.cfm) survey to find out: How much do you and your classmates vary?
