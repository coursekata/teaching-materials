The `giant_sal` data set: Salamander Growth in Mack Creek\n\n<img src=\"https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/reference/figures/and_salamander.jpg\" alt=\"Coastal Giant Salamander at Mack Creek study site\" width=\"250\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 20px; height: auto;\"> \n\nBiologists studying coastal giant salamanders in Mack Creek (Willamette National Forest, Oregon) wanted to know how the harvesting of forests affects salamander growth. Forest harvesting involves cutting down trees, which could change the creek environment in which the salamanders live and thus impact how large they grow to be. \n\nTo investigate this, they captured and measured the length of 60 coastal giant salamanders. Some salamanders were captured in areas where trees had recently been cut down (clear-cut), while others came from untouched old-growth forest. Your task is to explore this dataset, called `giant_sal`, to find out whether forest harvesting impacts salamander size.\n\n### Variables in the `giant_sal` Data Frame:\n\n- `year`: The year the salamander was caught and measured  \n- `location`: The section of forest in which the salamander was caught (clear cut or old growth)\n- `habitat`: Where in the creek the salamander lived: Coded as `pools` (deeper, slower-moving parts of the creek) or `cascades` (shallow, rocky areas with faster-moving water)\n- `length_mm`: Body length in millimeters, measured from its snout to the start of its tail (excluding the tail)  \n\nNote: This is a subset of data from [the Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER) Network](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/reference/index.html)."
