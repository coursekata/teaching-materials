But homes also don't have a price tag on them. It's hard to judge the true value of a home. Real estate websites such as Zillow, Redfin, or Trulia often use statistical models to help people make a guess at how much a home is worth. \n\nIn this project, you will develop an advance model that makes predictions about the sale prices of homes based on a training data set called `homes` with 1460 homes. However, your model will be compared against other students' models on `homes_test` (a fresh set of data from 1459 homes). Your goal is to make accurate predictions not just in your training data but also in the testing data. So think hard about whether the variables or polynomials you include in your model should be included in your model of the DGP. \n\n## Data\n\nThe dataset you will be working with describes 1460 residential home sales in Ames, Iowa from the years 2006 - 2010, as reported by the Ames City Assessor's Office. Ames is located about 30 miles north of Des Moines (the state capitol) and is home to Iowa State University (the largest University in the state). Each row (observation) represents the latest sale of a home (one row per home in dataset). Columns represent home features and sale prices (outcome). More information on the specific variables in this data set can be found in [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ks61Le4HFRyYN9cYhfWg2J5fgSxvVVmZ/view?usp=sharing).\n\n\n## Instructions\n\nYour task is to use R to explore variation in the data, model the variation, evaluate your models, and then write up your methods and findings in a report for a real estate website (a client like Zillow or Redfin). Your complete data analysis report will have 5 sections: Introduction, Explore Variation, Model Variation, Evaluate Models, Discussion/Conclusions.\n\nIt is up to you to decide what kind of advanced model you would like to make and what explanatory variables you will include in your model. Your goal is to create a model that is able to explain the variation in sale price and thus makes better predictions of sale price. The top 10 models from the class (measured by the F statistic and/or the rationale for the model) will receive extra credit. Good luck!\n\n</div>"
