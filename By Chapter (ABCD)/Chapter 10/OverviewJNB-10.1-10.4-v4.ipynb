We want to model the Data Generating Process (DGP) that produced it! We want to know the model with the true parameters $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + e_i$ (not just the parameter estimates, $b_0$ and $b_1$).\n\nThe challenge is, we can’t observe the DGP directly. We only have data from a sample. The space between these two is called **the problem of inference**, the gap between what we want to know ($\\beta_1$) and what we know ($b_1$). \n\nOur work in this chapter is learning some new concepts that will help us bridge that gap."

This lets us test whether an empty-model DGP could produce a sample with a $b_1$ as big as 18.\n\nRun the code cell below. \n- In **Graph shuffles**, we’ve used `shuffle()` to create and graph a new variable, `time_shuf`, that represents one possible sample generated from an empty-model DGP. \n- In **Model shuffles**, we calculate the $b_1$ from the shuffled data."
