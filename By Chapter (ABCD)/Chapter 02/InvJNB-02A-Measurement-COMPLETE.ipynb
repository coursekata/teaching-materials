They will also run an experiment by modifying the height of the launching stick. The lesson serves to provide a social bonding activity as well as an embodied learning experience that provides first-hand experiences with the lesson concepts.\n\n#### Includes:\n- Practice thinking about where data come from\n- Distinguishing measurement error from mistakes\n- Practice operationalizing ideas such as the *best* way to launch the bears, and the *best* way to measure the distance they flew\n- Designing an experiment (with the number of lift sticks in the catapult)\n- Thinking about how variation in one variable (e.g., lift sticks) can affect another variable (e.g., distance)\n\n</div>"

Once we get that data, we want to use data science to figure out whether this stuff changes, improves, differs across people, or predicts some future outcome, and much more.\n\nBut it all starts with figuring out measurement -- how would we know how much of something exists? How would we know how that thing varies across people, animals, families, companies, countries?\n \nLet’s start by measuring something easy. The distance traveled by gummy bears! We’ll build some catapults, launch some gummy bears, and measure how far they flew!\n"

We need to evaluate many factors when deciding what a hate crime is. The person committing the hate crime may not define a hate crime the same way as the victim of a hate crime, or as the person in power (e.g., legal representatives, judges, etc.) who is executing the law. A researcher may also use a different definition based on their objectives.\n\nIt is kind of like the measurement error we see in gummy bear distances because what counts as a hate crime may vary from person-to-person, or situation-to-situation.\n\n</div>"
