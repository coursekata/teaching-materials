Explore the data frames and choose one that interests you for this assignment.\n\nOption 1: `biopics`\n\n- A biopic is a movie based on the true life story of some famous person or group. This data frame contains information on the main subjects (i.e., the main character or characters) of biopics. There are 14 variables describing information about the subject, such as the race, sex, and occupation of the subject, as well as information about the film, such as the year of the release of the film, and box office earnings.\n- [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSIvQ9v5TSTXK2CMKaHqqfpav1LAkjhtoKEA_FXnNUL3J7EWeAwa2ridlK6JwwiD2TqOMMJLukMHzps/pub) for a description of all the variables.\n\nOption 2: `college_recent_grads`\n\n- This data frame contains information on the various college majors of recent graduates. There are 21 variables, such as the number of students who graduate from a major, median earnings for a major, etc.\n- [Click here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/fivethirtyeight/versions/0.5.0/topics/college_recent_grads) for a description of all the variables.\n\nOption 3: `All_NBAPlayers`\n\n- This data frame contains information on each player who has been part of an NBA teams' roster between 1997-2022. There are 28 variables, such as age, team, games played, number of starts, minutes played, etc.\n- [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15HckBzX17-LpQxfzgFRYCHnhjHEkQ_NrxYxEtwtY2AA/pub) for a description of all the variables.\n\n\n\n\n</div>"
