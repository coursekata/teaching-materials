The example hypothesis then works through the question of whether number of views on a video predicts income.\n\n#### Goals of the Notebook:\n\n- Decide whether to include or exclude an outlier\n- See that the shuffled sampling distribution of $b_1$ gives us the same results as the sampling distribution of F and the ANOVA table\n- Give students a chance to explore their own hypotheses\n\n</div>"

Your students may be interested in doing their analysis with either `YouTubers` or `YouTubers_no_outlier` which excludes that super viral video. It would be good to discuss whether they think videos that go superviral are part of the same DGP that governs most other videos.
