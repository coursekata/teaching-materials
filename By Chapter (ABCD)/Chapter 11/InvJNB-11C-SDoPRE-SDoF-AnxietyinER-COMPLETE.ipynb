Several medically stable, adult patients visiting an emergency room were approached and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 15 minutes exposure to a certified therapy dog and handler (**Dog condition**), or usual care (**Control condition**). Patient-reported anxiety, pain, and depression were assessed using a 0â€“10 scale (10 = worst), at three time points: \n\n- baseline (before the therapy dog)\n- later (30 minutes after the therapy dog or control treatment)\n- last (90 minutes after)\n\n#### Study Procedure\n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/syjV5VSK/image.png\" alt=\"Diagram of Dog Therapy Study procedure\" width=800>"

Any difference we see in these two groups is likely due to random chance. \n\nHowever, because this data was collected in an experiment (with random assignment to these two conditions), condition *could have* caused the differences we see in the two groups. **But** it is important to keep in mind that randomness *could have* caused differences as well. Later we will learn how to rule out randomness as a DGP."
