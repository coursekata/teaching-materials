They learn to simulate sampling distributions for these statistics under the empty model and use them to evaluate whether the parameter estimates of a complex model could plausibly have arisen just by chance. This builds on earlier logic developed with sampling distributions of b1.\n\nStudents should understand that:\n- Just like with b1, we can simulate sampling distributions of model-comparison statistics like PRE and F assuming that the empty model is true.\n- Just like with b1, we build up the sampling distribution by shuffling the outcome variable to break any real relationship, repeatedly fitting the model, and recording the resulting statistic (PRE or F) each time.\n- The observed statistic (PRE or F) from the original data can be compared to the simulated distribution. If it is more extreme than most shuffled values, this suggests the model may capture a real effect in the DGP. (Unlike with b1, “extreme” values for PRE and F are large positive values.)\n- Just like with b1, a p-value can be estimated from the sampling distribution by calculating the proportion of shuffled values that are as extreme or more extreme than the observed value.\n- This approach is structurally identical to null hypothesis significance testing, but framed through the lens of model comparison.\n- Sampling distributions of b1, PRE, or F will lead to the same conclusion. For example, if we use the sampling distribution of b1 to reject the empty model as a plausible DGP, using sampling distributions of PRE or F will not only lead to the same conclusion (e.g., reject empty model), it will result in the same p-value. These are just different ways of exploring the same underlying question: Is the empty model a plausible model of the DGP?\n\n\n    \nA <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cn81sPCepswbaI-Ktdl1LK-lM5NE4Glsk1bjv8Ru6cI/edit?tab=t.5y2a0ykmi2fk\" target=\"_blank\">printable student guided-notes worksheet</a> is available to go with this Jupyter notebook, as well as a student version of this notebook.\n    \n</div>"

The `tally()` code is way easier.\n- F provides a model-comparison perspective; it tells us how much better our model fits compared to the empty model, not just the direction or size of the slope. The F-statistic also accounts for how complex our model is.\n- It’s good to know more than one way because it helps our thinking be more flexible. If we forget one method, we might remember the other. Also, learning both methods gives us another chance to reinforce ideas about shuffle, sampling distributions, alpha, and p-value.\n- One thing that’s annoying about F is that the shuffle code takes a little longer to run!\n\n**Teacher Note:**\nThis is a good chance for students to \"convince themselves\" that these two views are connected and that it is valuable to learn both. In psychology, this is called a *saying is believing* exercise.
