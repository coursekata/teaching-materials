Students will generate models of their hypotheses, then evaluate the Data Generating Process (DGP) by considering whether the empty model could have produced the sample $b_1$ estimate. There is an emphasis on thinking about the empty model of the DGP as the model with only the mean (or $\\beta_0$) plus error versus the explanatory model which includes the effect of the explanatory variable (where $\\beta_1$ does not equal 0).\n\n#### Highlighted Skills and Concepts:\n- Fitting group models\n- Visually estimating and interpreting $b_1$ estimates\n- Thinking about and modeling the empty model of the DGP with `shuffle()`\n- Thinking about the empty model of the DGP as $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_i$ or data = mean + error\n\n***Lesson Handout:***\n\n[This drawing handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SJgiMoF-aUK7RaCjM6wI5zHmVRYvyymnDEZxeDEQMK0/edit#) should be printed and passed out to your students as part of a drawing activity they will be asked to do in section 3.

Is it possible that your laptop use is affecting the other students around you? \n\nSome researchers decided to study this question with students trying to learn during a meteorology lecture. These students were randomly assigned to be seated right behind students using their laptop to multitask *or* right behind students who were taking paper notes. \n\n<img src=\"https://coursekata-course-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/UCLATALL/czi-stats-course/jnb_dJ1DDtFP-image.png\">\n \nAt the end of the lecture, all participants were tested on their factual comprehension of the lecture (20 questions) and their ability to apply the knowledge they learned (20 questions).\n\n#### Study information\n\nSana, F., Weston, T., & Cepeda, N.
