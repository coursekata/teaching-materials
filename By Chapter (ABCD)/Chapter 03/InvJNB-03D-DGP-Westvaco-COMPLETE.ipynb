We use it to align multiple examples to each other even though they are each in a different context. In this case the context is a comparison of the distribution of fair dice rolls and the distribution of fired employees.)\n\n1. We almost always start by just taking a look at the data... and data only represent a sample (sometimes we call this the empirical sample). \nIn the Westvaco case, we looked at the data for the people that were actually fired and those that were not fired. Things like 58 represent something about this sample.\n\n2. But in statistics, we are often interested in the Data Generating Process: how was that sample data generated? The hard thing about statistics is that we rarely have access to the actual DGP! But we can make little theories (or models) of the DGP.\nHere, we wondered -- could the DGP have had something to do with age? (e.g., FIRED = AGE + OTHER STUFF) Or did it have nothing to do with age? (e.g., FIRED = OTHER STUFF)\n\n3. Even though we can't look directly at the DGP, we can mimic a **random** DGP! We can mimic a random process that does NOT fire people based on age (or anything else). With computers, we can do this thousands of times! We can then wonder, \"Hm, even if we used a completely random process, sometimes we get a sample that looks like our empirical sample. Did our empirical sample come from a process like this random sample? Or from some other process?\"\n\n### Analogies\n\nA. *The Sample Distribution:*\n\n- **Dice** - If we take a sample of 24 dice rolls and do not get any rolls of 3, does this mean the die is not fair? Will it look like other random samples of 24 dice rolls?\n- **Westvaco** - The sample of people who were actually fired appears to have mostly older people. Is this likely to happen with other random samples?\n    \nB. *The Population Distribution/The DGP:*\n\n- **Dice** - the theory is that a fair die will have a uniform distribution, with every number having an equal likelihood\n- **Westvaco** - the theory is that the distribution of fired people should look similar to the distribution of all the employees (if they were truly fired randomly)\n\nC. *The Sampling Distribution:*\n\n- **Dice** - If we simulate several random samples (n=24) of dice rolls, how often do we get a distribution similar to our sample distribution? Sometimes we do not get any rolls of a particular number. Our samples don't look very much like a uniform distribution even though they came from a uniform DGP.\n- **Westvaco** -  If we simulate several random samples (n=22) of employees, how often do we get a distribution similar to our sample distribution? This is a hard question to eyeball but many students feel like our sample is maybe a bit more \"extremely old\" than the randomly generated samples. Some of the samples don't look very much like the population even though they were randomly selected from the gray histogram. \n\n</div>"
