When the DGP runs for a long time, it generates a population (the set of all cases and the variation among them at a given time). The population isn’t ever *done* being generated. It may change slightly from day to day, but as long as the same DGP is operating, the type of variation we see in the population stays similar over time.\n\nFrom the population, a researcher draws a sample. The variation we see in the sample comes from the variation in the population, which came from the DGP."

We learned how to randomly sample from these populations using the `sample()` function. But how did we get these 10,000 data points to begin with?\n\nThe answer is: we simulated them. They are not from “real” populations. Instead, we used functions in R to generate data that come from different population shapes (normal, uniform, exponential). These simulations are not the real-world DGPs. We use simulation as a technique to *model* how a population with a certain shape might be generated.\n\nFor example, to model a normal population, we used the function `rnorm()`, which generates values from a theoretical normal distribution with particular features (the default features are a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1)."
