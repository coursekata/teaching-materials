At this point, students are given an informal definition of explain variation, namely, that knowing an observation’s value on an explanatory variable will help you make a better guess as to its value on an outcome variable. They will learn to apply this concept as they make hypotheses, and make and interpret visualizations of bivariate relationships.\n\n- Students will learn the importance of distinguishing outcome variables from explanatory variables, and will use word equations of the form Outcome = Explanatory + Other Stuff to represent hypotheses about bivariate relationships.\n- Students will see word equations as informal models of relationships, and will recognize the importance of “other stuff” at the end to represent the idea that there are many unmeasured causes of variation in the outcome variable (a concept we will build on later in the book when students are introduced to the concept of error).\n- Students will learn to use R to explore a hypothesized relationship between two variables, starting with scatter plots, when both explanatory and outcome variables are quantitative, and they will begin to develop a visual sense of when an explanatory variable does or does not explain much variation in an outcome.\n- Students will notice the correspondence between the structure of word equations (outcome = explanatory) and the R code used in this book (gf_point(outcome ~ explanatory)). They will also learn that the outcome variable is usually mapped to the y-axis in a plot, the explanatory to the x-axis.\n\n    \nA <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PpI8hcXhjXy6WX4_5jJs4YZq7oQO51Q9uhcMXcq8ty8/edit?tab=t.5y2a0ykmi2fk#heading=h.wjaasjj3pg90\" target=\"_blank\">printable student guided-notes worksheet</a> is available to go with this Jupyter notebook, as well as a student version of this notebook.\n</div>"

A weak one doesn’t help you guess at all.  \n- In a strong relationship, the points kind of line up. In a weak one, they’re all over the place.\n- If the scatter plot looks like a random cloud, the variable probably doesn’t explain variation in the outcome.\n\n</div>\n"
