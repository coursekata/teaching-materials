We must, instead, intervene in the world, *create* variation in the explanatory variable, and then observe the outcome. In short, we must use an *experimental* research design.\n\nOne way to do this is by randomly assigning research units (e.g., people, mice, cities, etc.) to different values of the explanatory variable (often referred to as different *conditions*). Random assignment creates groups that are comparable—even if individuals are very different. Any differences between groups at the point of random assignment are due only to chance. Then, if we intervene in some way with one of the groups, we have stronger evidence that any subsequent difference on the outcome variable was caused by the explanatory variable."

With list_type, the real data looks very different from most of the shuffled data. That makes it seem like randomness wasn't the only cause of this difference.\n- General: If the real data looks similar to the shuffled plots, then the observed pattern could have been caused by a randomness alone. If the real data looks unusual compared to shuffled plots, then maybe randomness is not enough to explain this pattern and the explanatory variable might really matter.\n- Shuffling gives us a way to see what kinds of differences we might expect just by chance. \n    \n</div>"
