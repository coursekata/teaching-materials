They compiled the cost of textbooks from forty different courses across four disciplines. For each course the bookstore's website lists the required text(s), how many textbooks were required for that class, and the total cost for the required books. Data were collected for the Fall 2011 semester.\n\nVariables: There are three variables in the data frame.\n\n- `Field`: General discipline of the course (Arts, Humanities, NaturalScience, or SocialScience)\n\n- `Books`: Number of books required for that course\n\n- `Cost`: Total cost (in dollars) for required books\n"
