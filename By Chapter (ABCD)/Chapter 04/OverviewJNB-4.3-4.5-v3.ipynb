Variations of the Stroop tasks are still widely used today by researchers in many subfields of psychology. Today, you are going to be a participant in a classic Stroop task!\n\n**What is the Stroop task?** The classic Stroop task is very simple. The research participant is given a list of words and asked to _name the color of the font each word is printed in_ as fast as they can. How hard could that be?<br><br>\n\n<center><span style=\"color: red; font-size: 32px;\">\nRED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLUE\n</span></center>\n\nFor example, if you were given the list of two words above you would say, \"Red, red,\" because both words are printed in a red font. (If you said \"Red, blue\" that would be a mistake, though it is a common mistake.) <br><br>\n\n<div class=\"guided-notes\"> \n<h3>1.1 Collect some data and record it in the guided notes.</h3>\nFollow the steps below to collect data on the Stroop task.\n</div>\n\n**Step 1.** Pair up with a partner. Decide who will be the **timer** and who will be the **reader** for the first set of words (**section 1.2, below**).\n\n**Step 2.** The timer says \"Go\" and starts the time. The reader should name the font colors out loud as quickly as possible, row by row, until completing all five rows of words. Record the time in seconds in the data table on your guided notes.\n\n**Step 3.** Switch roles. Repeat Step 2 with the second set of words (**section 1.3, below**).\n    \n**Step 4.**  Write down times from other classmates until you fill up the table in your guided notes.\n"
