You can have students try to think of an experiment that can test whether high income or high rents cause homelessness. \n\nPart of the story here may be that higher income states also have higher rents. When higher income people live in an area, landlords can raise rents and still have people who can pay those prices. This also means that increasing overall income in an area may not be a solution - the higher the income, the higher the rents can be! \n\n</div>\n\n"
