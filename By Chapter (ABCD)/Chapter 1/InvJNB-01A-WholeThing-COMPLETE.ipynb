He sued the company for age discrimination. Students will examine the data of those who were fired and not fired, and try to rule out whether the firings were due to random chance or possibly discrimination by simulating repeated samples of random \"firings\" and compiling the average age of each sample. They then examine the resulting distribution to determine the probability of randomly firing that same number of people and getting the same average age or greater. The probability typically turns out to be quite low, but then students must grapple with the question: How low is \"low enough\"?\n\n#### Includes:\n\n- A broad overview of how all the major concepts of the course fit together\n- Practice representing hypotheses as word equations (DATA = MODEL + ERROR)\n- Thinking about randomness as a DGP--and one that we can simulate\n- Practice creating and manipulating R objects, and using simple functions such as `mean()`, `sum()`, `do()*`, `sample()`, `gf_histogram()`, and `tally()`\n- Introduction to the **Distribution Triad**\n    - **The DGP** (for which we have two hypotheses: Discrimination or Random Chance)\n    - **The Sample Distribution** (for which, we have our 1 empirical sample--the people who were actually fired), and\n    - **The Sampling Distribution** (which we generate by simulating lots of random samples and plotting their means)\n\n</div>"

We use it to align multiple examples to each other even though they are each in a different context.)\n\n1. We almost always start by just taking a look at the data... and data only represent a sample (sometimes we call this the empirical sample). \nIn the Westvaco case, we looked at the data for the people that were actually fired and those that were not fired. Things like 58 represent something about this sample.\n\n2. But in statistics, we are often interested in the Data Generating Process: how was that sample data generated? The hard thing about statistics is that we rarely have access to the actual DGP! But we can make little theories (or models) of the DGP.\nHere, we wondered -- could the DGP have had something to do with age? (e.g., FIRED = AGE + OTHER STUFF) Or did it have nothing to do with age? (e.g., FIRED = OTHER STUFF)\n\n3. Even though we can't look directly at the DGP, we can mimic a **random** DGP! We can mimic a random process that does NOT fire people based on age (or anything else). With computers, we can do this thousands of times! We can then wonder, \"Hm, even if we used a completely random process, sometimes we get a sample that looks like our empirical sample. Did our empirical sample come from a process like this random sample? Or from some other process?\"\n\n</div>"
