To understand what an \"interaction\" is, we want students to consider whether this is a situation where the interaction model is better or the additive model is better.  \n\n#### Includes:\n\n- Understanding what it means for an effect to be different at various levels of a predictor variable. Specifically, the presence of a tadpole definitely leads to some egg eating. But it's particularly true in the case of one type of egg (R. marina or cane toads). \n- Interpreting the overall PRE, F, and p-value (the Model row of the ANOVA table)\n- Understanding why an interaction model might explain variation better than an additive model.\n\nLink to original study: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.8655 \n\n</div>"

It's native to South America but 101 toads were introduced to Australia in 1935 as a form of pest control: to eat sugar cane beetles. Today, an estimated 1.5 billion of these prolific toads have invaded most of northwestern Australia, [where they've caused widespread death](https://www.science.org/content/article/long-dead-cane-toads-continue-haunt-australian-wildlife) among native reptiles and marsupials that try to eat them."

For each of 6 different species (C. alboguttata, C. brevipes, L. gracilenta, L. rubella, P. ornatum, and R. marina), 10 eggs from a single clutch were added to each of 20 containers. Ten containers were randomly chosen as the predation treatment and had one R. marina tadpole added. The remaining 10 containers served as the control group. The number of eggs surviving 72 hours later were counted by scientists.\n\nThe `TadpoleStudy` data frame has data from these 120 containers. These are the variables:\n\n- `EggSpecies` the species of frog or toad of the eggs\n- `Tadpole`  whether a tadpole was introduced to the container (\"TadPresent\") or not (\"TadAbsent\")\n- `TadSpecies` the species of the tadpole (all were \"R. marina\" tadpoles)\n- `TimeBlock` the day the experiment was carried out\n- `Dead` the number of eggs that did not survive after 72 hours\n- `Alive` the number of eggs that did survive after 72 hours\n"
