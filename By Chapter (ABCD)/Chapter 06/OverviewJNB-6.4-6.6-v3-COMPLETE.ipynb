Students will learn:\n\n- that standard deviation is the square root of variance, and understand that it represents the spread of a distribution in more interpretable units than variance.\n- how to calculate a z-score using R, and understand that z-score represents how far, in standard deviations, a score is from the mean of its distribution. \n- that both residuals and z scores express, in different units, how far a score is above or below the mean of its distribution. Z-scores are sometimes referred to as “standardized scores.”\n- that z-scores are a way to compare scores across different measures in different units based on their position relative to the mean, and will learn about when z-scores are useful and how they are used.\n        \nA <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeJYSOL1geQGdul-BhMr0kAy0pfVKZ91FSXsrRv2TCI/edit?tab=t.5y2a0ykmi2fk\" target=\"_blank\">printable student guided-notes worksheet</a> is available to go with this Jupyter notebook, as well as a student version of this notebook.\n    \n</div>"
