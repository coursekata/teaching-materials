In this chapter students will develop tools and concepts for quantifying total error around a model, aggregating across all data points. They also will be introduced to ways of using the distribution of errors for placing individual scores in context and for making different kinds of predictions. Finally, they will explore the idea of modeling a distribution with the normal distribution.\n    \n<b>Section Goals:</b> In this section students are introduced to the important concepts of Sum of Squares and variance as ways of quantifying how much total error there is around a model’s predictions. \n\n- Students learn that because the sum of the residuals around the mean will always be 0, it is not useful as a way of calculating total error. We typically use the sum of squared residuals because it is minimized at the mean of the distribution of any quantitative variable.\n- Students learn that squared residuals can be represented as squares on the coordinate plane, and that the sum of squares is literally the sum of the areas of the squares formed by squaring residuals.\n- Students also are introduced to the concept of variance, which is based on the sum of squares, but adjusted by sample size to be per observation, making it comparable across different samples. \n- Students learn to use R to calculate sum of squares and variance from a data frame directly and by using the supernova() function.\n    \n</div>"

It's predictions will always be a little off from the data. But some models do a better job than others.\n\nSo far we have learned to make a very simple model: the empty model (on the left). Later we will learn to make more complex models (like the one on the right). Both of these models are based on the same data points. Just looking at them, you may think that one model has more error than the other. But how much more?\n\nIn order to compare the two models accurately, we need a **measure** of how much total error there is around a model. Developing such a measure is the focus of this lesson, starting with the empty model.\n\n<img src=\"https://coursekata-course-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/UCLATALL/czi-stats-course/6.1-6.3-overview-empty-complex.jpg\" width=\"90%\">\n"

And it's not that the empty model literally has 0 error.\n\nIf students think summing residuals might work, you might consider asking:   \n- The sum of residuals from the empty model was 0. Does that mean the model makes no error? \n- If we compared two different models and both had sums of zero, how would we decide which is better?\n\nThe goal is to help them see that “balancing” is not the same as “small error.” Hopefully students see a need for a measure of error that doesn’t cancel positives and negatives. \n\n</div>"

Variance is simply the SST divided by n-1 (the n stands for the number of data points). In this way, variance corrects for the difference in sample size between the two datasets.
