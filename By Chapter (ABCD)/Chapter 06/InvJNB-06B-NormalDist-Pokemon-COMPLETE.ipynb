Over the years, there have come to be over 800 fictional Pokémon species that range from animal-like to plant-like creatures, and even species based on inanimate objects (like *Klang* which looks like interlocking gears). \n\nThere are eighteen different Types of Pokémon (such as Grass, Water, Fire, etc.) and each type has its own individual strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Grass is generally strong against Water, Water is usually strong against Fire, and Fire is generally strong against Grass (similar to the game “Rock, Paper, Scissors”). \n\nThe goal of the game is to become the strongest Trainer by catching and training as many Pokémon as you can and battling them against your opponent’s Pokémon (hence, the slogan “Gotta catch ‘em all!”). When you catch a Pokémon, they shrink down into poké balls that can fit in your pocket."

Scratch, Punch)\n- `Defense`: The base damage resistance against normal attacks\n- `SpAttack`: Special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)\n- `SpDef`: The base damage resistance against special attacks\n- `Speed`: Determines which Pokémon attacks first each round\n- `Generation`: A grouping of the Pokémon games that separates them based on the Pokémon they include (each generation, a new set of Pokémon, moves, and Abilities that did not exist in the previous generation are released)\n- `Legendary`: A group of incredibly rare and often very powerful Pokémon, generally featured prominently in the legends and myths of the Pokémon world"
