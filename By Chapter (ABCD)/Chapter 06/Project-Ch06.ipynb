It contains 218 observations on 33 variables such as population, life expectancy, GDP, health, economy, and happiness.\n- [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otfwo54jp-DNu2HRBVSQ6lO5562P-xPNQJrR_st6KNk/pub) for a description of all the variables.\n\nOption 2: `nfl_games`\n\n- This data frame has data on the results for all NFL games Games from the 1999 to 2023 seasons. It contains 6707 observations on 29 variables such as game date, points scored, game times, temperature, and stadium.\n- [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WA-CCYO38RhO0x257pZS62r3m13cKawMzQls4U9y5EE/pub) for a description of all the variables.\n\nOption 3: `StudentSurvey`\n\n- The data set contains data from an in-class survey given to introductory statistics students over several years. It contains 362 observations on 17 variables such as exercise, smoking, GPA, and piercings.\n- [Click here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Lock5Data/versions/2.6/topics/StudentSurvey) for a description of all the variables. \n\n*NOTE: We have changed the names of the categories in the variable `Year` in the `StudentSurvey` \ndata frame from \"FirstYear, Sophomore, Junior, Senior\" to: \"9th, 10th, 11th, 12th\"*\n\n</div>"
