(2016)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1604586113#sec-7)\n\nResearchers wanted to test a new way of motivating healthy eating among teens. They thought that traditional public health messages (e.g., “eat more fruits and vegetables because it’s good for you”), don’t always work well with adolescents because they can feel a little obvious or preachy.\n\nInstead, the researchers tried reframing healthy eating as an act of freedom and resistance, a way to push back against manipulative food industry practices such as the unfair targeting of young people. In this “expose” version, healthy eating was connected to values of autonomy and justice, not just health.\n\nStudents were randomly assigned to receive one of these messages: expose or public-health. Then they were asked to rate some ads.\n\nIn our in-class version, we only rated at one ad (Sprite) but [students in the original study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1604586113#sec-7) rated advertisements for three different drinks (Sprite, Coca-Cola, and Gatorade). They were asked how *angry* the ads made them and how much the ads made them want to *drink* the product. Their responses to the three ads were averaged together.\n\nThe data frame `junkads_study`, contains data from a sample of 89 students with the following variables:\n- `message` whether the student read the expose or public health message\n- `SpriteOpen_ended` the open-ended written response to the Sprite ad\n- `angry` (1–5) on average, how angry the three ads made them feel\n- `drink` (1–5) on average, how much they wanted to drink the product after seeing the ad"

We could reject it or not, but that’s a limited answer.\n\nA better question is: What could $\\beta_1$ be?\n\nIn reality, $\\beta_1$ could take on a range of values. Our goal is to figure out which of those values are most consistent with our sample data.\n\nThe basic idea is illustrated in the animation below. The blue number lines represent the possible values of $\\beta_1$ (the population parameter) and $b_1$ (the estimate from the sample). \n\nThe animation starts with the sampling distribution we constructed for the empty model. Then, using hypothetical thinking, we imagine sliding that distribution up and down the number line, each position representing a different possible value of $\\beta_1$:\n- When the sampling distribution is shifted to the right, we’re imagining a DGP where $\\beta_1$ is larger (sometimes, much larger than our sample $b_1$).\n- When it’s shifted to the left, we’re imagining a DGP where $\\beta_1$ is smaller.\n"

Bootstrapping assumes that the entire population is made up of many, many copies of individuals just like the ones in our sample.\n\nThe `resample()` function creates new samples by drawing individuals (rows) from our data frame with replacement.
