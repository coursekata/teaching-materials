One of Leonardo’s rules was that the height be equal to the span of the outstretched arms (another way to say it is that height = 1 x armspan). You may have seen this sketch by da Vinci:\n\n\n<center> <img src=\"https://coursekata-course-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/UCLATALL/czi-stats-course/jnb_33jThDLw-Test-Ch-8-da-Vinci.jpg\" title=\"Pattern 1\" width=\"300\"/> </center>\n\n\nThe following are some measurements from a sample of students who wanted to explore this idea that the height equals the armspan (use the `read.csv()` function to read the following CSV file link: https://tinyurl.com/davinci-stats). \n\nThe following variables can be found in this data frame:\n\n- `height_cm` the student’s height in cm\n- `armspan_cm`  the student’s arm span in cm\n- `kneelingheight_cm` the student’s height when kneeling in cm\n- `handlength_cm` the student’s hand length in cm\n- `hours_studied` number of hours the student studied\n- `exam_score` the student’s exam score (out of 100)\n- `height_mediansplit` median split of height_cm (short, tall)\n- `attendance` whether the student had perfect attendance (perfect, not perfect)"
