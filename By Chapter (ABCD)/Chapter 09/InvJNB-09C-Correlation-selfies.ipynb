Scores can range from −25 to 25; higher scores indicate higher self-objectification\n- `narcissism` Score on four items from Narcissistic Personality Inventory; higher scores indicate higher narcissism\n- `machiavelli` Score on four items from the Mach IV scale; higher scores indicate higher tendencies toward manipulation\n- `psychotic` Score on four items from the Psychopathy Scale; higher scores indicate higher levels of subclinical psychopathy\n- `age` Age of the participant\n- `agerange` Whether the participant is < 25 years old, 25 - 30 years old, 31 - 35 years old, or over 35 years old\n- `timeonsocialmedia` Self-reported estimate of time spent each day on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest in minutes, as a sum\n- `numselfies` Self-reported estimate of how many pictures taken of themselves and posted on the social networking sites in the past week \n- `numphotos` Self-reported estimate of how many pictures participants had posted in the past week that were not of themselves\n- `photoediting` Self-judgment of how often participants edit their photos before posting them (e.g. filters, cropping parts of themselves out), on a 5-point scale (1 = Never; 5 = Often)\n"
