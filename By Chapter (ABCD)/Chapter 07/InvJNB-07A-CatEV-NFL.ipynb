Last name\n- `team`\t\tTeam at time of suspension\n- `games`\t    Number of games suspended (one regular season = 16 games); some individuals were suspended indefinitely (coded as \"Indef.\")\n- `wrongdoing`  The type of wrongdoing; the two possible types are: Personal conduct, or Substance abuse\n- `repeat_offense` Whether it was a repeat drug offense or not\n- `description`\tDescription of offense\n- `year`\t\tYear of suspension\n- `source`\t    News source\n\nNote that this data set has been condensed. There are two other categories of wrongdoing that are more specific to athleticism that players can be suspended for (e.g., in-game violence and performance enhancing drugs). The two categories of wrongdoing here are ones that also have criminal implications (e.g., a regular person would also be punished for these offenses)."
