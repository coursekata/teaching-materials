Luthor plots his ultimate revenge that could see millions killed and change the face of the planet forever, as well as ridding himself of the Man of Steel.                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 When the kingdom's most wanted-and most charming-bandit Flynn Rider hides out in a mysterious tower, he's taken hostage by Rapunzel, a beautiful and feisty tower-bound teen with 70 feet of magical, golden hair. Flynn's curious captor, who's looking for her ticket out of the tower where she's been locked away for years, strikes a deal with the handsome thief and the unlikely duo sets off on an action-packed escapade, complete with a super-cop horse, an over-protective chameleon and a gruff gang of pub thugs.\n6 John Carter is a war-weary, former military captain who's inexplicably transported to the mysterious and exotic planet of Barsoom (Mars) and reluctantly becomes embroiled in an epic conflict. It's a world on the brink of collapse, and Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands.                                                                                                                                                                          \n  release_year release_month release_day revenue    runtime\n1 2011          5            14          1045713802 136    \n2 2007          5            19           961000000 169    \n3 2015          4            22          1405403694 141    \n4 2006          6            28           391081192 154    \n5 2010         11            24           591794936 100    \n6 2012          3             7           284139100 132    \n  tagline                                        tmdb_popularity\n1 Live Forever Or Die Trying.                    135.41386      \n2 At the end of the world, the adventure begins. 139.08262      \n3 A New Age Has Come.                            134.27923      \n4                                                 57.92562      \n5 They're taking adventure to new lengths.        48.68197      \n6 Lost in our world, found in another.            43.92699      \n  tmdb_user_rating tmdb_num_ratings\n1 6.4              4948            \n2 6.9              4500            \n3 7.3              6767            \n4 5.4              1400            \n5 7.4              3330            \n6 6.1              2124            "},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"outputs_reference":"s3:deepnote-cell-outputs-production/d8104b84-26cb-4b04-a8ba-6c8c3395af7d","content_dependencies":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"6c24079b237744418f20831f13a32aae","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n\n**Sample Response**\n\nPirates of the Carribeean: On Stranger Tides \n\nThe second largest budget was another movie from the same franchise. \n\n</div>","block_group":"31dc9715717f46aca277895f9238ea53"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"e39a3567c6194ddf988b535cc391b064","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"5.
