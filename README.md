# teaching-materials

Welcome to our repository of CourseKata teaching materials!

Currently, you will find all of our Jupyter Notebook (JNB) lessons housed here.

They are organized in two ways:

- By Chapter: All of the JNBs for a chapter are in one folder.
- By Type: All of the JNBs are organized by type (Investigation, Mini, Overview, Projects, and Tests)

You can download files individually, or you can download the entire repo by clicking the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP". 

Keep in mind that we update materials continuously so check back regularly for changes!
