Thus, he could make all 4 shots (.906^4), OR (remember, \"or\" means \"add\") he could have made the first 3 and missed the last one [.906 ∗ .906 ∗ .906 ∗ .094], OR he could have made the first 2 and the fourth but missed the third [.906 ∗ .906 ∗ .094 ∗ .906]...and so on with the many possible outcomes.
