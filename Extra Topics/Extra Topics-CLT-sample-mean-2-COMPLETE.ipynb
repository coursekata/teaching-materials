However, three patterns tend to emerge:\n\n- **Shape:** Regardless of the hypothesized shape of the population distribution (e.g., die throws were uniform in shape, thumb lengths were normal) the SDoM tends to have a normal shape.\n\n- **Center:** The mean of the SDoM seems to have the same mean as the hypothesized population distribution.\n\n- **Spread:** SDoMs appear to be vary less (are less spread out) than the population distributions that they come from.\n\nIn this notebook, we want to explore whether these three properties of sampling distributions of the mean are always true, or just happen to have been true of particular DGPs.\n\nWe also want to explore some other sampling distributions, of statistics other than the mean. We can imagine a sampling distribution of any statistic we can calculate based on a sample (e.g., variance or median). Do these sampling distributions have the same properties as the sampling distribution of means?\n"
