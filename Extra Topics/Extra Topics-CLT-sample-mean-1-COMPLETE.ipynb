We can do that in R in one line of code (e.g., `do(1000) * mean(...)`) which runs in 10 seconds or less. Before, it would have been days of work!"

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) describes the shape, center, and spread of a distribution of sample means of equal size when each sample is randomly chosen from some population. And the CLT has been proven; it’s a mathematical law which means that it is true of sampling distributions of means from all kinds of populations—not just the ones we have simulated.\n\nAccording to the Central Limit Theorem, sampling distributions of means are known to have the following characteristics:\n- The **shape** of the distribution of means ($\\bar{Y}$) will typically be normal in shape, provided the sample size ($n$) is large enough OR if the shape of the population is normal.\n- The **mean** of the distribution of means ($\\mu_{\\bar{Y}}$) often called the **expected value**) will be the same as the mean of the population ($\\mu$) from which the samples are randomly chosen. That is, the sample means will center around the true population mean.\n- The **standard error**, the standard deviation, of the distribution of means ($\\sigma_{\\bar{Y}}$), will be smaller for larger sample sizes. Even more specifically, the standard error will be equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size ($\\sigma_{\\bar{Y}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$)"
