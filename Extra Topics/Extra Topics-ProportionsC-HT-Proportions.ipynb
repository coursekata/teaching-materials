Specifically, there is a significant difference between the median earnings of white people and black people.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/mL0x25Lv/HT-2-Prop-Earnings.png\" title=\"Earnings\" width = 600/>\n\n[Economic Policy Institute, 2018](https://www.epi.org/blog/black-workers-have-made-no-progress-in-closing-earnings-gaps-with-white-men-since-2000/)\n\nWe may be able to at least partially explain this racial wage gap with social factors, such as inequity of schools, differences in the social networks people have access to, or differences in choice of career. On the other hand, there may still be direct discrimination in the labor market during the hiring process.\n\nResearchers wanted to test if direct hiring discrimination was still a factor in labor markets. In their study*, investigators created mock resumés that were identical except that each resumé was randomly assigned either a commonly-white or commonly-black name. \n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/q4X1qvpJ/HT-2-Prop-Resumes.png\" title=\"Resumes\" width = 600/>\n\nNote: These names were used as the main example in the original study paper.\n\nThe resumés were sent to 4,890 job placement ads in Chicago and Boston, and included a wide swath of jobs in the following industries: sales, administrative support, clerical services, and customer services. They also included a large range of positions, from “cashier work at retail establishments and clerical work in a mailroom to office and sales management positions.” The researchers measured which group got more callbacks from potential employers.\n\nNote: This lesson presents a slightly simplified version of their study design. However, the data in the lesson is identical to the real study data. See citation below for their full paper:\n\n*\\*[Bertrand, Marianne and Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873). \"Are Emily And Greg More Employable Than Lakisha And Jamal? A Field Experiment On Labor Market Discrimination,\" American Economic Review, 2004, v94(4,Sep), 991-1013.*\n\n\n**Today’s Key Analysis**\n\nDoes a statistically significant difference in callbacks indicate broader discriminatory practices?"

For example, the study did not investigate any potential\ndifferences in starting salary offers, employer responses to in-person interviews, or whether or not\napplicants are given job offers. Every level of the hiring process may operate differently, therefore, the\ndiscrimination found in call back rates does not necessarily indicate discrimination for the other levels.\n\nHowever, if there is discrimination in callbacks, one could make the case that this initial roadblock would\nsignify a practically important challenge to the entire application process. It doesn’t matter if the\ninterview process, job offering process, and starting salary offer process is equal if applicants can’t even get to those parts of the process due to initial discrimination in the first place (no callback). In other words, if an applicant can’t get their foot in their door, it doesn’t matter how they’d be treated when they actually enter the room.\n\nAnother challenge to this study’s scope of inference comes from the fact that these resumés were sent\nin response to newspaper ads for jobs. This is an uncommon channel for finding a job in today’s world.\nDiscrimination in more modern channels of applying for jobs could be better or worse – more study is\nneeded in this area.\n\n</div>"
