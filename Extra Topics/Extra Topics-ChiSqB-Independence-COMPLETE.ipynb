Some students may argue that these differences can only be explained by police\nracial bias. Other students may argue that there are separate underlying variables, such as the\nindividuals’ cooperation, why they were stopped, etc., that could explain the differences.\n\nAlthough racial bias may be the most likely explanation, this dataset is consistent with multiple possible\nexplanations that involve the underlying variables mentioned above (or others). So, we do not have\nenough information to draw causal conclusions about police officer bias.\n\nTo further the discussion, you can share with students this prominent [study from a Harvard economist](https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force),\nwho analyzed the same data. It found that, even when controlling for the potential underlying variables\nmentioned above, racial differences in force levels remained. This result suggests police bias, but still\ndoes not quite prove it (even though the controls seem pretty comprehensive, there may still be other\n“uncontrolled” variables).\nOne further note:\n\nOur dataset shows that persons of color are stopped at disproportionally high rates. If stops were done\ntruly randomly, many more white people would be stopped. This doesn’t necessarily pertain to use of\nforce, but it’s an important point to stamp when talking about the sample sizes.\n  \n</div>"
