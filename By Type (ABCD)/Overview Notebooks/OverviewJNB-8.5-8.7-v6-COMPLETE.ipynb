      "source": "<div class=\"teacher-note\">\n    \n<b>Section Goals:</b> This section begins with a discussion of effect size, and introduces Cohen’s d, which uses standard deviation as a unit for describing the size of an effect. It then returns to the broader goal of statistical modeling: to understand the Data Generating Process (DGP), not just explain variation in the sample data. Students revisit the shuffle() function (from Chapter 4) as a strategy for exploring whether patterns in the data could emerge just by chance, even if there were no effect of the explanatory variable (X) in the DGP.\n\nStudents should understand that:\n\n- b1, PRE, and F are all ways of describing the size of an effect. Cohen’s d is a measure that converts b1, which is in units of the outcome variable, into a standardized measure in terms of standard deviations.\n- The goal of modeling is not just to reduce error in the current dataset, but to make inferences about the underlying processes in the DGP that could have generated the observed pattern of variation.\n- A model may fit a sample well but still reflect patterns that arose by random chance, rather than a true effect in the DGP.\n- The shuffle() function allows us to simulate a DGP in which the explanatory variable has no effect (i.e., the empty model is true). It breaks the relationship between the variables and uses randomness to create patterns of data.\n- By repeatedly shuffling the data, fitting a model, and recording the resulting b1, students generate the beginnings of a sampling distribution of b1s under the empty model. This distribution helps evaluate whether the observed b1 is similar to b1s we’d expect by chance alone. If the observed b1 is more extreme than most of the shuffled b1s, this suggests the observed data may have been generated by a different process, one in which the explanatory variable does have an effect.\n    \nA <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ri9XrtI93IzbmPHOZb19TFWJ5roc4Ol8iURpdHX9dM/edit?tab=t.5y2a0ykmi2fk\" target=\"_blank\">printable student guided-notes worksheet</a> is available to go with this Jupyter notebook, as well as a student version of this notebook.\n    \n</div>"

A sample of 90 high school students were surveyed as to what type of pet they have, and also how happy they are feeling these days. The findings from that dataset were as follows: Dog owners rated themselves as the happiest, cat owners as the least happy. Students who had both a cat and a dog fell in between the other two groups.\n\nFor purposes of this notebook we are going to analyze a reduced subset of these data, a sample that includes only cat owners (n=30) and dog owners (n=30). The name of the dataset is `cat_or_dog`.\n\nTheir are 60 rows and two variables in the `cat_or_dog` dataset:\n\n- `pet_type`: `Cat`, `Dog`\n- `happiness`: a 1-10 scale with 1=Extremely Happy, 10=Extremely Unhappy\n"
