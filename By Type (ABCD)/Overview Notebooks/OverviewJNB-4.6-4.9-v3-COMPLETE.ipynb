They will learn to visualize these relationships with faceted bar graphs, contingency tables, and the use of color. \n\n- Students will expand their use of word equations to represent hypothesized relationships when the outcome variable is categorical, which is a good chance to review the distinction between a variable (e.g., gender) and its possible values (female and male).\n- Students will use R to create faceted bar graphs and contingency tables, and should also be allowed to explore why other visualizations (e.g., faceted histograms or scatter plots) are not useful for visualizing categorical outcome variables.\n- Students should understand when proportions (gf_props, or tally with format = “proportion”) might be preferable to frequencies and vice versa.\n- Students will learn to represent multivariate hypotheses with word equations, and to visualize them using attributes such color, size, shape, and multiple facets in their plots.\n- Students will also begin to think more abstractly about what it means to explain variation, categorizing the sources of variation in an outcome variable as explained or unexplained (what we have termed “other stuff” in our word equations).\n- Students will understand that adding more explanatory variables will reduce the amount of unexplained variation; and that unexplained variation can be further divided into variation that is explainable and variation that is unexplainable.\n\n\n    </ul>\n    A <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpnhdgY3jXPMyvD2XQ4uBJtEHsKS9gdAA3vw4rJ9juA/edit?tab=t.ruav1w6j7tle\" target=\"_blank\">printable student guided-notes worksheet</a> is available to go with this Jupyter notebook, as well as a student version of this notebook.\n</div>"

Each character was rated on a number of character traits by more than 3 million volunteers as part of the [Open Psychometrics Project](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/). \n\nFor example, volunteers were presented with the character Darth Vader (from *Star Wars*), and asked to indicate, using a slider, where Darth Vader would fall on a 100-point scale from punchable (coded as 0) to loveable (100). The average rating for a subset of these dimensions is saved in the `epic_char` data frame. The data frame includes 8 variables.\n\n<img src=\"https://coursekata-course-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/UCLATALL/czi-stats-course/jnb-rate-characters.jpg\" alt=\"example of how people rated a character with a slider\" width = 50%>\n\n### The Variables\n\n- `char_name` The character's name.\t\n- `uni_name` The universe name of the book, game, movie, or TV show.\n- `gender` The gender of the character (M=Male, F=Female).\n- `chill_quant` Average rating of how chill (vs offended) the character is on a scale from 0 (offended) to 100 (chill).\n- `chill_cat` Coded as *offended* if the character had a score less than 50 on `chill_quant` and *chill* otherwise\n- `loveable_quant` Average rating of how loveable (vs punchable) the character is on a scale from 0 (punchable) to 100 (loveable).\n- `loveable_cat` Coded as *punchable* if the character had a score less than 50 on `loveable_quant` and *loveable* otherwise\n\n#### Data Source: \n\nThe complete data set from which `epic_char` was drawn was made available by Tanya Shapiro as a [Tidy Tuesday data set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-08-16)."
