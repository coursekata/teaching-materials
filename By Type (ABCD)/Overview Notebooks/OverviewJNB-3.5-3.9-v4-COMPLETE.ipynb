They will learn that different tools are required to explore the distributions of categorical variables, and will learn to make frequency tables and bar graphs. Students will:\n<ul>\n<li>Learn which representations are appropriate for categorical variables (e.g., frequency tables/tally, bar graphs) and which for quantitative variables (histograms, box plots, five-number summary).\n<li>Understand that representations of the distributions of categorical variables show the frequency or proportion of observations in each category and that the mode is the center of a categorical variable’s distribution.\n    </ul>\n    A <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/119MEtx0kcSCz_9_h48ggfLuia1--9_1swHwG0DoeZaU/edit?tab=t.5y2a0ykmi2fk#heading=h.wjaasjj3pg90\" target=\"_blank\">printable student guided-notes worksheet</a> is available to go with this Jupyter notebook, as well as a student version of this notebook.\n</div>"

They might come from a different Data Generating Process (DGP) than the rest of the data. For this reason, sometimes researchers will decide to omit outliers from their analyses.\n\n### 7.2 How R defines an outlier\nOutliers are data points that are so far outside of the main part of the distribution that they may not be generated by the same DGP that generated the rest of the data points. Sometimes researchers will decide to omit outliers from their analyses for this reason. There is no one way to define what counts as an outlier, but R uses this definition: **If a data point is more than 1.5 times the IQR below Q1, or more than 1.5 times the IQR above Q3, it is considered an outlier.**"
