We must, instead, intervene in the world, *create* variation in the explanatory variable, and then observe the outcome. In short, we must use an *experimental* research design.\n\nOne way to do this is by randomly assigning research units (e.g., people, mice, cities, etc.) to different values of the explanatory variable (often referred to as different *conditions*). Random assignment creates groups that are comparable—even if individuals are very different. Any differences between groups at the point of random assignment are due only to chance. Then, if we intervene in some way with one of the groups, we have stronger evidence that any subsequent difference on the outcome variable was caused by the explanatory variable."

One group might, by luck, be a little faster. (Maybe a few more faster readers got assigned to that group.)\n\nSo when we see a difference between the groups (e.g., congruent group is faster than incongruent group), there are three possible explanations for this difference:\n\n1. **It was caused by the explanatory variable:** The explanatory variable actually causes the outcome to be different.\n2. **It was caused by random sampling variation:** – The difference happened just by chance.\n3. **It was caused by a combination of explanatory variable and randomness.**\n"
