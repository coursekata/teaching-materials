In this notebook we are going to sort through these ideas, and hopefully help you see why they are important.\n\n### 1.1 Some definitions\n\n**Sample:** The cases that got selected and measured and so ended up in our data. (Real and known)\n\n**Population:** All the cases in the world from which we sampled, and that we want to understand.

When the DGP runs for a long time, it generates a population (the set of all cases and the variation among them at a given time). The population isn’t ever *done* being generated. It may change slightly from day to day, but as long as the same DGP is operating, the type of variation we see in the population stays similar over time.\n\nFrom the population, a researcher draws a sample. The variation we see in the sample comes from the variation in the population, which came from the DGP."

That’s where simulation comes in.\n\nUsing R, we can make assumptions about a population and simulate multiple samples from it. By examining the many “children” produced by a single “parent,” we can explore whether our actual sample could plausibly have come from that population—or if it seems unlikely."

We learned how to randomly sample from these populations using the `sample()` function. But how did we get these 10,000 data points to begin with?\n\nThe answer is: we simulated them. They are not from “real” populations. Instead, we used functions in R to generate data that come from different population shapes (normal, uniform, exponential). These simulations are not the real-world DGPs. We use simulation as a technique to *model* how a population with a certain shape might be generated.\n\nFor example, to model a normal population, we used the function `rnorm()`, which generates values from a theoretical normal distribution with particular features (the default features are a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1)."
