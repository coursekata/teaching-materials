Data starts with variation in the messy world around us. Every dataset starts with a decision: What do we want to measure, and who (or what) should we measure it from?\n\nThese two big decisions are called:\n- **Sampling**: choosing the cases (e.g., people, animals, products) we want to study\n- **Measurement**: deciding what we want to record about each case, and how to do it\n\nToday, our class will act as both researchers and participants. You’ll be the cases, and we’ll measure different features of you by asking questions like: \"What’s the worst color?\" We'll use our data as an example to help us understand some key ideas about data: \n\n- What is a \"case\"? *Each person is one case in our dataset.*\n- What is a \"variable\"? *“Worst color” is one variable we're measuring.*\n- What do we mean by a \"value\"? *Each person’s answer—like “brown” or “neon green” is a value*.\n- And how do we organize all this information into a usable dataset?"
