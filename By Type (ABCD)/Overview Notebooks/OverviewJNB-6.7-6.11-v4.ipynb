There are many different Pokemon, each with different abilities and stats. You “battle” by choosing different Pokemon to go up against opponents. Knowing how powerful your opponent’s Pokemon is could give you an edge.\n\nOne of the simplest measures of a Pokemon's power is **Hit Points (HP)**, the amount of damage it can take before it faints.  \n\n- Higher HP generally means a tougher, more powerful Pokemon.  \n- For example, a basic Pikachu might have **60 HP**, as noted in the upper right corner of the card.\n\n> **Note for Pokemon experts in the room:** Even though the game is more complicated than just comparing HP, we’re going to simplify and treat HP as a “measure of power” to help everyone (even those who have never played Pokemon) get on the same page.\n\nIf you could **predict your opponent’s Pokemon’s HP**, that would give you some sense of how strong they might be in a battle. This makes HP a perfect example for thinking about distributions, probabilities, and predictions.\n"

Imagine a Pokemon game designer who has to decide how many Hit Points (HP) each Pokemon should have. Here are some of the things they must consider:\n\n- If every Pokemon had super high HP, battles wouldn’t be very interesting.  \n- If every Pokemon had really low HP, battles *also* wouldn’t be very interesting.  \n- If HP values were spread evenly across the whole range, the difference in hit points between two opponents would be large, making too many battles wildly one-sided.\n\nTo keep the game fair and fun, game makers usually design HP (and other features) to follow a **bell-shaped distribution**: Most Pokemon have HP clustered around the average, while only a few are extremely weak or extremely powerful. \n\n### 1.2 Simulating a distribution of HP\n\nLet's consider a game maker who decides that the mean HP of all Pokemon should be 75 HP with a standard deviation of 25. Run the code below to generate a bell-shaped (normal) distribution of HP for 1000 Pokemon, save them in a vector called `hp`, and then make a histogram to show the resulting distribution."

We can use this distribution to calculate probabilities and make predictions about what future cards might be like.  \n\nWe’ll explore this idea with three questions. The questions are similar, but not identical. The first question is most concrete, with each of the next two questions a bit more abstract: \n\n1. **Proportion:** What *proportion* of cards have HP > 75?  \n2. **Probability:** Imagine that each card from `hp` is mixed up in a giant hat. What is the *probability* of drawing one with HP > 75?  \n3. **Future prediction:** Imagine getting a new Pokemon card *in the future*. What is the probability it will have HP > 75?  \n\nLet’s get started with the first, most concrete question.\n\n### 2.2 Run the cell below to get (again) the histogram of `hp` that was generated above"

This is actually much more common.  \n\nFor Pokemon HP, the game maker has not published information about the DGP they use to generate cards. But even if they did, the real-world distribution may not be the same as the DGP that intitially was used by the game maker. Why not? Think about the following: \n\n- Billions of cards are printed each year.  \n- Some Pokemon (like Pikachu) are fan favorites, so more of them may be in circulation.  \n- Once cards are out in the world, some are lost, damaged, or destroyed.  \n\nBecause of factors like these, the actual distribution of HP among cards in the real world is hard to know!\n\n**If we don’t know the population distribution, how can we estimate the probability that my *next* card will have HP lower than Pikachu (60 HP)?** We will refer to this probability as P(HP < 60).\n"

If we only have a sample of n=30 or n=360, it may look kind of like the ones we sampled above. \n\nUp to now, we have estimated probabilities in the population by calculating proportions of a sample distribution. But we can also estimate probabilities using mathematical functions. Whereas histograms based on real samples of data can be very jagged and uneven, mathematical models typically are smooth, continuous functions. \n\nTo use a mathematical model we must make some guesses about the shape, center, and spread of the population. In this section we will explore why we might want to do that."

The normal curve is a **continuous mathematical function** (that's why it's also called a **probability density function**).  \n\nSo instead of counting, we calculate the **area under the curve** that falls within a range of values on the x-axis (e.g., HP < 60, or HP > 75, or HP between 50 and 100). The total area under the curve is considered to be 1.0 (representing all of the probability).The proportion of total area that falls within a specified range of values represents the **probability** of a value falling in that range.
