      "source": "Following traumatic experiences, some people have flashbacks, which are also called “intrusive memories.” Research suggests that one way to reduce intrusive memories is to try to change the memory during reconsolidation, a process that occurs immediately following reactivation of a previously formed memory. During reconsolidation, traumatic memories can be weakened to the point that they are no longer intrusive.    \n\nBecause intrusive memories are often visual, James and colleagues (2015) explored whether playing Tetris during memory reconsolidation (i.e., right after reactivation of the memory) would interfere with the storage of that memory, and thereby reduce future intrusive memories. The researchers hypothesized that participants who played Tetris after reactivation of the traumatic memories would experience fewer future intrusive memories than those who did not play Tetris.\n\nTo test their hypothesis, the authors recruited 72 participants to their study. As summarized in the table below, all participants came into the lab (**Session 1**) and watched a traumatic video that included lots of graphic violence. After watching the video, participants rated how distressing they found the video to be on a 10-point scale (`Distress`).  During the first 24 hours after watching the video, participants recorded the number of intrusive memories they experienced (`Intrusions.baseline`), a measure of their baseline level of intrusive memories.  \n\nTwenty-four hours after Session 1, participants came back into the lab for an Experimental Session. They were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: \n\n- **No-task control**: Participants completed a 10-minute filler task and went home.\n\n- **Reactivation + Tetris**: Participants viewed images from the trauma film designed to reactivate the traumatic memories (i.e. reactivation task). They then played Tetris (Tetris) for 12 minutes.\n\n- **Tetris Only**: These participants played Tetris for 12 minutes, but did not view the traumatic images. \n\n- **Reactivation Only**: Participants viewed images from the trauma film designed to reactivate the traumatic memories (i.e. reactivation task), but did not play Tetris.     \n\nAfter completing the Experimental Session, participants were asked to record the number of intrusive memories they experienced for the next seven days (**Intrusions.afterExp**).   \n\n\n<img src=\"https://coursekata-course-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/UCLATALL/czi-stats-course/jnb_x9xp3Yg9-Test-Ch-12-Tetris-Study-Table.png\" title=\"Tetris Procedure\" width=\"900\"/>"
