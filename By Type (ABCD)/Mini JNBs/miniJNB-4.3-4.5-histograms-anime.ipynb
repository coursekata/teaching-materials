MAL provides a list-like system so users can organize and score preferred anime and manga. The site claims to have 4.4 million anime and 775,000 manga entries and records millions of visitors a month.\n\nThe `anime` data frame contains 3,259 anime TV series with the following 15 variables:\n    \n- `name` anime title - extracted from MAL\n- `title_japanese` title in Japanese (if anime is Chinese or Korean, the title, if available, in the respective language)\n- `type` anime type (e.g., Movie, Music, ONA-original net animation, OVA-original video animation, Special, TV); all anime in this data frame are TV type\n- `source` source of anime (i.e original, manga, game, music, visual novel etc.)\n- `genre`\tgenre\n- `studio`\tstudio\n- `episodes`\tnumber of episodes\n- `decade` decade started\n- `rating`\tsuitability for certain audiences (None, G, PG, PG-13, R, R+)\n- `score`\tMAL allows users to score the anime on their list on a scale from 1 to 10. These scores are then aggregated to give each anime in the database a rank from best to worst. Higher indicates better anime. \n- `scored_by`\tnumber of users that scored; this data frame only contains anime scored by at least 100 users\n- `rank`\trank - weight according to MAL formula (available at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyAnimeList))\n- `popularity`\tbased on how many users have the respective anime in their list\n- `members`\tnumber users that added this anime in their list\n- `favorites`\tnumber users that favorites this anime in their list\n\nThese are a subset of data from the various rankings and scores available at [MyAnimeList.net](MyAnimeList.net). The data set was originally featured on [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-04-23), made available by [Tam Nguyen via Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nthanhtam), and cleaned by [David Smale](https://davidsmale.netlify.app/portfolio/customising-ggplot2-graphics/) and further cleaned by CourseKata."
