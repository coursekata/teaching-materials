Students were given 5 seconds to view the problem and then asked to write down their best guess as to the answer. The answer, of course, is the same regardless of order. However, students' guesses differed markedly between the two groups.\n\nData are stored in a data frame called `anchor_data`. The dataset has has 72 students and two variables:\n\n- `condition` - a categorical variable coded as \"ascending\" or \"descending\"\n- `guess` - a numerica variable with each student's guess"

Test your predictions: Let's get R to switch the order of the groups\nBy default, R puts the category labels in alphabetical order and makes the one that comes first the reference group.

For example, we could change the label from `ascending` to `xascending`. (By putting the \"x\" before ascending, we made it come later in the alphabet. We also could have used any other letter that comes after \"d\".) We've done that in the code cell below, saving the results in a new variable called `xcondition`."
