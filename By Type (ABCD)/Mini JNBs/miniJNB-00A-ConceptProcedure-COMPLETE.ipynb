They often resort to the procedure of setting up a fraction addition problem and finding the common denominator. However, this results in an answer that does not make any sense in the context of the problem. A drawing of the bean piles will clearly show this. Applying a procedure without also applying conceptual understanding can lead to mistakes in our approach and the conclusions we draw.\n \n</div> "
