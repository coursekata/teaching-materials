They should consider things like p, PRE, and F, as well as the interaction model row of the supernova() output.\n \n#### Includes:\n\n- Trying to predict the lines of a multivariate model\n- Comparing the interaction model to the additive model to see which one is the better fit\n- Evaluating PRE, F, and p-value for additive vs interaction models\n- Interpreting the interaction row of an ANOVA table\n\n\n</div>"

Just comparing the additive model to the overall interaction model, the F is much smaller for the interaction model (40.66 compared to 67.47) even though the PREs are very close (.55 compared to .54), thus, we are not getting as much explained variation per degree of freedom in the interaction model over the additive model.\n \n***Additive Model***\n- F = 67.46\n- PRE = .54\n- p-value < .05\n\n***Interaction Model***\n- F = 40.66\n- PRE = .55\n- p-value < .05\n\n> ***Interaction Row***\n- F = 0.76\n- PRE < .01\n- p-value = .47\n \n</div>"

While both of these factors can help us explain variation in waste, economic development (with a higher PRE) seems to be explaining more of the variation than urbanization.\n\nI would recommend market policies and incentives for more reusable products.\n\nBased on this, another theory I would like to explore is whether population would be a stronger predictor in the model than percent_urban because there can be non-urbanized areas that still have a lot of people, and more people probably make more waste.\n\n \n</div>"
