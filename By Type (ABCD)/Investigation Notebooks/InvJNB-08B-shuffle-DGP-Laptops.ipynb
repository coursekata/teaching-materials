Is it possible that your laptop use is affecting the other students around you? \n\nSome researchers decided to study this question with students trying to learn during a meteorology lecture. These students were randomly assigned to be seated right behind students using their laptop to multitask *or* right behind students who were taking paper notes. \n\n<img src=\"https://coursekata-course-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/UCLATALL/czi-stats-course/jnb_dJ1DDtFP-image.png\">\n \nAt the end of the lecture, all participants were tested on their factual comprehension of the lecture (20 questions) and their ability to apply the knowledge they learned (20 questions).\n\n#### Study information\n\nSana, F., Weston, T., & Cepeda, N.
