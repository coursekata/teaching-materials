They will have the freedom to explore any multivariate hypothesis they are interested in. Many of the potential outcome variables lack variation and are highly skewed with outliers, so students will be need to decide how to handle these outliers, and will likely be faced with a model that does not explain any variation. There are also slides and a printable worksheet to help students understand PRE by drawing Venn Diagrams.\n \n#### Includes:\n\n- Fitting and interpreting multivariate models\n- Dealing with outliers\n- Interpreting a model that does not explain any variation\n- Drawing Venn Diagrams of PRE\n\n<b>Teacher Resources:</b> \n\n\nLink to [sample slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16vD_BcpKw-1-6oIe_S8Ar5wtLq8sMC5_x3MSaOJNSt4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nLink to [printable handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dEG1phIGxmx8dEDLM_s1HbszCydJaJa5Keb18kuOzQg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n</div>"
